  <h1>All My Fandoms</h1>
        <img src="family.jpg" alt="family">
    <p>I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy in a lot of forms.
        My favorite combination is sci-fi comedy. I blame the combination
        of my mom being a huge nerd and PBS for this. Let me explain...</p>

        <h2>Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987 - 1994)</h2>
        <h3>Fandom: Trekkie</h3>

      <p>It all starts with <b><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</b></em>! My
        mom always enjoyed <b><em>Star Trek: The Original Series</b></em>
        because that's what she grew up with. Her big brother was a fan
        and controlled the television, so she had no choice but to watch.
        But it didn't matter because this started a life long journey into
        Trekkie life. All my Trekkie love starts with The Next Generation. It continues
        with Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise on on TV.
        All movies with the Star Trek brand is a must see, even the ones that aren't the best
        because its still Trek.</p>

         <h2>Doctor Who (1963 - the sun dies or BBC cuts budgets, erases tapes, etc)</h2>
         <h3>Fandom: Whovians</h3>

       </header>
       <p>I got the pleasure of watching <b><em>Doctor Who</b></em> because of PBS.
    I don't really know when they started show it but I was pretty young, probably
    6 or 7. I watched the Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker in adventures and saw his
    regeneration to the Fifth Doctor, Peter Davidson. I didn't know what was going
    on but it was fun! I was completely geeked once the
    BBC came to its senses and revived the series in 2005. Its still going strong
    and I love the current Doctor and can't wait for the next series.</p>
        <header>
          <h2>Red Dwarf (1988 - who knows?)</h2>
          <img src="reddwarf.jpg" alt="red dwarf cast">
          <h3>Fandom: Smegheads (Which is just a curse word in this show)</h3>
        </header>
        <p>This I can blame on PBS too. I was a teenager when KETC started showing
        this series. It should really be higher on the list because it made
        me realize that I love the combination of comedy and science fiction.
        It made me laugh, made me think and call people Smegheads under my
        breath without them knowing what I was talking about! The perfect series
        in my opinion and they are still producing episodes. I need to watch
        stuff with longevity</p>
      <header>
        <h2>Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1997 - 2003)</h2>
        <img src="buffy.jpg" alt="buffy the vampire slayer cast">
        <h3>Fandom: Scoobies</h3>
      </header>
        <p>Buffy! Buffy! Buffy! When I was a high school/college student Buffy was life.
        I couldn't wait till the next episode! I read spoilers, I looked a photos
        from upcoming episodes, I read fanfiction! It was all about the iconic Chosen One
        to battle vampires and creatures from the Hellmouth.</p>
